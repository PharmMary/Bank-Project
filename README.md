## The problem to be solved with data mining is understand customerâ€™s behavior and improve term-deposits

## The goal is to develop machine learning systems that will help the bank segment their customers and to predict if a customer will make a term-deposit.

## The Steps includes:
  ### Data Understanding/Overview - Data Cleaning,Feature Engineerng
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  ### Deposit Detection System (Supervised machine learning)
   #### Feature Engineering -Split data into independent and dependent variable(target)
   #### Data Preprocessing - Normalisation using MinMaxscaler
   #### Encoding using label Encoding
   #### Train-Test Split
   #### Model Building- fit data to the train model, test the model and Evaluation the predicted values using various metrics
  ### Customer Segmentation Detection System (Unsupervised machine learning)
   #### Data Preprocessing - Normalisation using MinMaxScaler
   #### Encoding using Label Encoding
   #### Determine number of clusters using the Elbow method
   #### Fit data to Kmeans clustering model
   #### Evaluate the model using the silhouette score
   #### Visualise and interpret the clusters
