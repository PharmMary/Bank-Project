## INTRODUCTION
The Director of a financial institution contacted my company because they were interested in leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the bank and improve their efficiency. The Financial institution is dedicated to delivering unparalleled banking services to her clients, with a mission to establish enduring relationships with her customers by providing tailored financial solutions that align with their individual needs and goals.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem to be solved with data mining is understand customer’s behavior and improve term-deposits. The goal is to develop machine learning systems that will help the segment their customers and to predict if a customer will make a term-deposit.
 The data provided by the institution had features relating to clients demographics, customer behaviours and campaign efectiveness. It will be used to carry out various analysis and develop systems that will gain insights into the customers' behaviour, improve relationship with Customer, create solutions that meets individual’s needs, optimise operations, promote a better and more effective marketing campaign strategy, and in turn improve bank’s efficiency. 
 
## PROJECT STEPS:
  ### Data Understanding/Overview - Data Cleaning,Feature Engineerng:
  Data is clean and ready for analysis, the clients' are between the age of 18 and 95 year-old. They were grouped into 5 different age groups and an age group column is created
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

  
  
  ### Deposit Detection System (Supervised machine learning)
   #### Feature Engineering -Split data into independent and dependent variable(target)
   #### Data Preprocessing - Normalisation using MinMaxscaler
   #### Encoding using label Encoding
   #### Train-Test Split
   #### Model Building- fit data to the train model, test the model and Evaluation the predicted values using various metrics
   
  ### Customer Segmentation Detection System (Unsupervised machine learning)
   #### Data Preprocessing - Normalisation using MinMaxScaler
   #### Encoding using Label Encoding
   #### Determine number of clusters using the Elbow method
   #### Fit data to Kmeans clustering model
   #### Evaluate the model using the silhouette score
   #### Visualise and interpret the clusters
