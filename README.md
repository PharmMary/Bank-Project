## INTRODUCTION
The Director of a financial institution contacted my company because they were interested in leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the bank and improve their efficiency. The Financial institution is dedicated to delivering unparalleled banking services to her clients, with a mission to establish enduring relationships with her customers by providing tailored financial solutions that align with their individual needs and goals.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem to be solved with data mining is understand customer’s behavior and improve term-deposits. The goal is to develop machine learning systems that will help the segment their customers and to predict if a customer will make a term-deposit.
 The data provided by the institution had features relating to clients demographics, customer behaviours and campaign efectiveness. It will be used to carry out various analysis and develop systems that will gain insights into the customers' behaviour, improve relationship with Customer, create solutions that meets individual’s needs, optimise operations, promote a better and more effective marketing campaign strategy, and in turn improve bank’s efficiency. 
 
## PROJECT STEPS:
  ### Data Understanding/Overview - Data Cleaning,Feature Engineerng:

## RECOMMENDATION
Base on the insights: -
The bank should have customized products that will serve the clusters of customers e.g student/school fees term-deposit for the students and retirement term deposit for the aged/retired people. With this the bank will be able to meet the needs of targeted customers and also get new customers to save with the bank

In this campaign the customers that were contacted within 1 to 4 times over 1st to 31st of the month subscribed to term-deposit, therefore its advisable to limit the marketing campaign calls to less than 4 to avoid unproductive calls and minimize cost of marketing.

A short term maturity term-deposit should be packaged for those in the low income earners carder

## CONSTRAINTS
Information on the Income status of the customers were not provider, This would have enabled one to understand their spending capacity.
